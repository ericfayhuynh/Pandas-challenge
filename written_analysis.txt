It looks like there is a positive correlation between average percent overall passing of the student's reading and math scores to the budget of the school. Charter schools have a higher passing rate compared to Districts. And there is no difference among the grades in each school. And there is a negative correlation between the school size and student's math and reading scores. Two conclusions to draw from the given information is that increased spending on students will have a positive impact on the student's overall scores and as school size increases there will be a negative impact on the student's overall scores. Increased spending may mean there will be more resources available for the student to learn and perform well in tests. Decrease in school size would mean less compeition for school resources or more individual time spent per student with teachers or tutors.
